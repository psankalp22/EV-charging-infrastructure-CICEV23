# EV Charging Infrastructure Classification - CICEV23

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for classifying DDoS attacks targeting Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure using deep learning techniques. The project leverages the CICEV2023 dataset to identify and mitigate malicious activities in EV charging stations.

## Project Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning and transformation of raw data from the CICEV2023 dataset.

2. **Model Training**  
   - Deep learning models for classifying DDoS attacks.

3. **Analysis**  
   - Evaluations and visualizations of model performance.

4. **Report and Presentation**  
   - Final reports and presentations for CS 658 project.
